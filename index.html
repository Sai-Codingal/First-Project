            <li>About half an ounce of fuel is needed to start a car. Meanwhile, it takes about 2.7 cups of coffee for a
                human to get started!
            <li> Airbags move at speeds up to 4,500 MPH and deploy within 40 milliseconds of collisions. They are
                designed to deploy at impact speeds of 19 MPH. I hope this fact isn’t inflated.
            <li>The average car contains over 30,000 parts. It’s a guarantee at least one of them will break
            <li>Every year, over $60 billion worth of car maintenance goes unperformed. That can equate to billions in
                repairs later on!
            <li>Faulty oxygen sensors account for many check engine light related issues. Not the check engine light!
            <li>The average car has more than 100 miles of code in the vehicle’s internal computer. How does it fit in
                there?
            <li>The average vehicle owner can expect to pay about $400 a year on scheduled maintenance, diagnostics, and
                other repairs. That’s a lot less than costly repairs down the road!
            <li> The average auto repair costs about $305.55. Includes parts, labor, tax, and associated inconvenience!
            <li>The average American spends nearly two weeks of their life sitting at red lights. Better than sitting at
                the DMV.
            <li>Traffic congestion wastes about three billion gallons of fuel each year. Talk about a gas guzzler!
